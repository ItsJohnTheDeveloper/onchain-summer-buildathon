# Social Recovery

Our mission at Social Recovery is to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for crypto wallet owners. We understand the importance of security and accessibility in the world of digital assets. That's why we've created a unique recovery system that allows users to connect with their friends and family via passkeys. These trusted individuals can then sign transactions on the wallet owner's behalf, providing an additional layer of security and peace of mind. Our goal is to make the management and recovery of digital assets as seamless and social as possible, ensuring that no one loses access to their crypto due to lost keys or forgotten passwords.

## Technologies Used

- **Supabase**: Used as the database for this project. Supabase offers a generous free tier, making it a great choice for small to medium-sized projects.
- **Tanstack Query (formerly React Query)**: Used for client-side caching. This helps to improve performance by reducing the number of requests to the server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the application. It also includes a dark/light mode configuration.

## Demo

The demo fetches sample Postgres data from both the client side and a server action. Both of these actions use Tanstack Query for caching.

## Setup

The initial setup of this project took approximately 3 hours. This included setting up the database with Supabase, configuring Tanstack Query for client-side caching, and setting up the theme with Tailwind CSS.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm run dev`

## Future Work

Future improvements will include more advanced features and optimizations. Stay tuned for updates.
