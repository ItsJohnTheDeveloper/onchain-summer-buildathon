# Verdict App

Verdict is an innovative application designed to settle disputes in a unique and engaging way. It allows users to create prompts related to their disputes, inviting others to provide their perspectives or solutions. The core of Verdict's functionality lies in its integration with OAO AI, which analyzes the responses to determine the most suitable solution, effectively settling the dispute.

Upon the resolution of a dispute, Verdict showcases the winning answer, bringing closure to the matter at hand. To further incentivize participation and reward the winning contributions, Verdict integrates with the Crossmint Client SDK, enabling the distribution of NFTs to winners. This not only provides a tangible reward for their insightful contributions but also encourages a healthy and constructive environment for resolving conflicts.
